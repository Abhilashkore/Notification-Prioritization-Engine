# Notification Prioritization Engine

An intelligent rule-based system that prioritizes notifications based on urgency,
type, and timestamp to reduce information overload.

## Features
- Priority scoring system
- Rule-based ranking logic
- Real-time sorting
- Easy integration
- Lightweight and scalable

## How It Works
Each notification is assigned a priority score based on:
- Urgency Level (High, Medium, Low)
- Notification Type
- Timestamp

Notifications are then sorted dynamically based on their computed score.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Project

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Example Output

Sorted notifications will be displayed in order of priority.
